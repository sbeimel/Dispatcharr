"""
Queryset helpers that resolve effective Channel field values.

Each Channel can optionally have a related ChannelOverride row carrying user
edits to any subset of its user-facing fields. Sync never touches the override
row; provider metadata flows directly into Channel.* and the override table
sits alongside with a nullable value per field. The helpers here coalesce the
two sources into `effective_*` annotations so output querysets can sort,
filter, and emit values correctly at SQL level (avoiding 23+ Python-side
resolutions across the codebase).
