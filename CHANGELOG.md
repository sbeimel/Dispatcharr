# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.14.0] - 2025-12-09

### Added

- Sort buttons for 'Group' and 'M3U' columns in Streams table for improved stream organization and filtering - Thanks [@bobey6](https://github.com/bobey6)
- EPG source priority field for controlling which EPG source is preferred when multiple sources have matching entries for a channel (higher numbers = higher priority) (Closes #603)

### Changed

- EPG program parsing optimized for sources with many channels but only a fraction mapped. Now parses XML file once per source instead of once per channel, dramatically reducing I/O and CPU overhead. For sources with 10,000 channels and 100 mapped, this results in ~99x fewer file opens and ~100x fewer full file scans. Orphaned programs for unmapped channels are also cleaned up during refresh to prevent database bloat. Database updates are now atomic to prevent clients from seeing empty/partial EPG data during refresh.
- EPG table now displays detailed status messages including refresh progress, success messages, and last message for idle sources (matching M3U table behavior) (Closes #214)
- IPv6 access now allowed by default with all IPv6 CIDRs accepted - Thanks [@adrianmace](https://github.com/adrianmace)
- nginx.conf updated to bind to both IPv4 and IPv6 ports - Thanks [@jordandalley](https://github.com/jordandalley)
- EPG matching now respects source priority and only uses active (enabled) EPG sources (Closes #672)
- EPG form API Key field now only visible when Schedules Direct source type is selected

### Fixed

- EPG table "Updated" column now updates in real-time via WebSocket using the actual backend timestamp instead of requiring a page refresh
- Bulk channel editor confirmation dialog now displays the correct stream profile name that will be applied to the selected channels.
- uWSGI not found and 502 bad gateway on first startup

## [0.13.1] - 2025-12-06

### Fixed

- JWT token generated so is unique for each deployment

## [0.13.0] - 2025-12-02

### Added

- `CHANGELOG.md` file following Keep a Changelog format to document all notable changes and project history
- System event logging and viewer: Comprehensive logging system that tracks internal application events (M3U refreshes, EPG updates, stream switches, errors) with a dedicated UI viewer for filtering and reviewing historical events. Improves monitoring, troubleshooting, and understanding system behavior
- M3U/EPG endpoint caching: Implements intelligent caching for frequently requested M3U playlists and EPG data to reduce database load and improve response times for clients.
- Search icon to name headers for the channels and streams tables (#686)
- Comprehensive logging for user authentication events and network access restrictions
- Validation for EPG objects and payloads in updateEPG functions to prevent errors from invalid data
- Referrerpolicy to YouTube iframes in series and VOD modals for better compatibility

### Changed

- XC player API now returns server_info for unknown actions to align with provider behavior
- XC player API refactored to streamline action handling and ensure consistent responses
- Date parsing logic in generate_custom_dummy_programs improved to handle empty or invalid inputs
- DVR cards now reflect date and time formats chosen by user - Thanks [@Biologisten](https://github.com/Biologisten)

- M3U account and profile modals now scrollable on mobile devices for improved usability

## [0.12.0] - 2025-11-19

### Added

- RTSP stream support with automatic protocol detection when a proxy profile requires it. The proxy now forces FFmpeg for RTSP sources and properly handles RTSP URLs - Thanks [@ragchuck](https://github.com/ragchuck) (#184)
- UDP stream support, including correct handling when a proxy profile specifies a UDP source. The proxy now skips HTTP-specific headers (like `user_agent`) for non-HTTP protocols and performs manual redirect handling to improve reliability (#617)

- EPG Source dropdown now sorts alphabetically - Thanks [@0x53c65c0a8bd30fff](https://github.com/0x53c65c0a8bd30fff)
- M3U POST handling restored and improved for clients (e.g., Smarters) that request playlists using HTTP POST - Thanks [@maluueu](https://github.com/maluueu)
- Login form revamped with branding, cleaner layout, loading state, "Remember Me" option, and focused sign-in flow
- Series & VOD now have copy-link buttons in modals for easier URL sharing
- `get_host_and_port` now prioritizes verified port sources and handles reverse-proxy edge cases more accurately (#618)

### Fixed

- EXTINF parsing overhauled to correctly extract attributes such as `tvg-id`, `tvg-name`, and `group-title`, even when values include quotes or commas (#637)
- Websocket payload size reduced during EPG processing to avoid UI freezes, blank screens, or memory spikes in the browser (#327)
- Logo management UI fixes including confirmation dialogs, header checkbox reset, delete button reliability, and full client refetch after cleanup
